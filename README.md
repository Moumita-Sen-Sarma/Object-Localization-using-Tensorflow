# Object-Localization-using-Tensorflow

In this  project, TensorFlow's Keras API is used to create a **Convolutional Neural Network** which will be trained to **Classify** as well as **Localize Emojis** in images. 

Localization, in this context, means the position of the emojis in the images. This means that the network will have one input and two outputs. In Object Localization, it is considered that there is just one object in any given image, and the CNN model will classify and localize that object. 

The dataset used in this project, can be found [here](https://github.com/hfg-gmuend/openmoji/releases/latest/download/openmoji-72x72-color.zip) !
For training the model, custom callbacks and custom metrics in Keras are also used in this project.
